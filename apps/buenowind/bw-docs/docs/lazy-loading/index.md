# Lazy Loading

Lazy loading means we only load the parts of the app the user needs at the start, instead of
everything at once. This makes the app load faster because it downloads less code initially.

For example, if an app has a bunch of features, lazy loading might only load the main part of the
app and the first feature the user wants to use. The more features we have, the less code the
user has to download at first.
