# Feature as a black box

Another benefit of isolation is that when we have multiple lazy-loaded features that are fully isolated
from each other, we gain a lot of flexibility in how we choose to solve specific use cases for each feature.

As the Angular and frontend landscape evolves, we might want to adopt new best practices without
spending time updating all our existing code to match them. The older features still work as expected,
and investing in migrating them doesn't provide much business value.

With a properly isolated architecture, we can keep the older features intact while introducing new
best practices in the newer features. This also means that if some features aren't up to the desired
quality standards, the impact of those issues is contained within that feature.

Isolated features can be treated as a **black box**, so even if their internal implementation isn't perfect,
the effects of any shortcomings are limited to that feature and don't affect the rest of the application.
