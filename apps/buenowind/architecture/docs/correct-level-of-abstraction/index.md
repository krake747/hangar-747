# Correct level of abstraction

A key recommendation is to resist the temptation to introduce unnecessary or overly complex
abstractions into our codebase. While it may seem like a good idea to create clever solutions,
these "cute little abstractions" can add complexity without providing significant value,
making the code harder to maintain and understand in the long run.

Abstraction can be a useful and powerful tool when used correctly, in practice it is being overused
and doing more harm than good, hence the recommendation to prioritize isolation.

Every team and project is different and an abstraction, when used correctly
can also be a tool that increases the team delivery velocity. Just keep in mind
that such abstraction is more likely related to repetitive business.
