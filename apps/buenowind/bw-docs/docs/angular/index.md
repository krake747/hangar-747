# Angular

Angular provides well-defined building blocks such as **components, directives, pipes,**
**services,and routes**, offering a structured approach to application development.

- Components handle the UI with templates.
- Services manage backend requests, data transformation, and state handling.

These core elements follow Angular's underlying systems and are categorized into two main types:
**standalones** and **injectables**.
