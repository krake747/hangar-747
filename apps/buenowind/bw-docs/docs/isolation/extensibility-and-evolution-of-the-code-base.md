# Exensibility and evolution of code base

When we keep parts of our code isolated, it makes the code easier to extend and change over time.
It's much easier to make changes in an isolated feature compared to a feature that's tightly connected
to everything else in the code.

The architecture we're focusing on encourages this isolation. It helps make sure that different parts
of the project can evolve without affecting each other.
