# Core

The first type we're going to discuss is the core which will live in the `core/`
folder of our application.

- Implementation in `core/` folder
- Eager, available from start, part of the initial bundles size
- Only **injector based (headless) building blocks** like services, interceptors, guards, functions...
- Application configuration and setup in the `provideCore()`
- Content can (and should) be sub-structured based by domains (or features), e.g. `core/user/`,
`core/auth/` or `core/product/`
- Core **logic is globally accessible** and can be accessed by any `layout`, `feature` and `pattern`
- Core is the place to extract logic, if it needs to be used by more than one `feature`, `pattern`
or `layout`

The core is the right place for all logic that needs to be available from the
start like authentication state, current user or guardsâ€¦ Or in other words,
anything that is necessary to be able to display information in the layout
before loading of a specific lazy feature.

The second most common content of the core will be domain (or feature)
specific injector based (headless) logic that is shared by more than one lazyloaded
feature.
