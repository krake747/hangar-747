# Black box nature

Lazy features are like self-contained "black boxes" that don't affect the rest of the app.
If their code gets messy, it's okay because the mess stays inside.

This means we can focus on delivering features quickly without worrying too much about perfect code.

If a lazy feature becomes outdated or no longer useful, we can easily throw it away and replace it
instead of spending time fixing it. But we should only do this when the user experience changes a lot,
and starting fresh is faster than fixing the old code.
