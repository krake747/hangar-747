# Correct level of technical abstraction

Now that we understand the issues caused by unnecessary abstractions, the key question is:
**What is the correct level of abstraction?**

The answer is simple:

- Angular itself
- The chosen state management library (e.g., NgRx, NgXs)

Sticking to these two layers ensures a **sustainable and maintainable** codebase.
Avoiding unnecessary custom abstractions keeps the project aligned with Angular's evolution,
simplifies migrations, and reduces long-term technical debt.
This approach is the most **responsible choice** for both the project and the organization.
