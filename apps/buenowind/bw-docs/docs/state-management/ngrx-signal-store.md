# `NgRx/signals`

`NgRx SignalStore` is a modern way to manage state in Angular using signals.
We define our state with `withState`, and SignalStore gives us reactive access to each part.
It's simple, reactive, and gaining traction in the Angular ecosystem.

!!! Note

    `NgRx Signals` is the new default.

    The NgRx team recommends using the @ngrx/signals library for local state management in Angular.
    While `ComponentStore`(https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store) remains supported,
    we encourage using `@ngrx/signals` for new projects and considering migration for existing ones.
