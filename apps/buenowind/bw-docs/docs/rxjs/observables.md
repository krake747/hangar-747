# Observables

An observable is like a stream or a pipe that sends us values over time. We can think of it like
watching a mailboxâ€”every time something new arrives, we're notified.
It lets us react when something happens, whether it's immediately or later.

In Angular, observables are built-in and used all over the place. For example, when we want to get
route parameters or listen to user input or wait for server data, we're usually working with observable
streams. Angular is already using them behind the scenes, so using them in our code fits right in.
