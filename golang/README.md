# Go Learning Journey

This folder tracks my progress as I learn Go for cloud-native development and DevOps tooling.

## Learning Resources

* **[Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/)**
* **[Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)**
* **[The Deeper Love of Go](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books/deeper)** (by Josh Arundel)

## 1. Learn Go Basics (Current)

Focus areas:

* syntax, types, structs, functions, methods
* slices, maps, pointers
* error handling
* modules
* basic concurrency (goroutines, channels)

Goal: write small, idiomatic Go programs.

## 2. Build a Simple Web API with Echo

Next step:

* set up an Echo project
* basic routing
* JSON responses
* request handling
* logging and middleware
* containerizing the API

Goal: create a minimal Go web service to build on later.
