# Faster Developer Feedback Loop

As developers, when we make changes to the code, we want to see those changes reflected in the app
as quickly as possible. This fast feedback loop boosts productivity and keeps us focused.

Lazy loading benefits us here too, as it breaks the app into smaller chunks. When we're working on a
specific feature, the system only needs to rebuild and reload that small piece, not the entire app.
This results in much quicker updates.

Imagine rebuilding a small 87KB file instead of a massive 3.2MB file! With lazy loading,
we can typically see changes in under a second, while without it, it might take over 3 seconds.
This faster feedback loop helps us stay focused and work more efficiently.
